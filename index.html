          (Abstract) We stand at the dawn of ubiquitous connectivity through 6G
          wireless, but its foundational reliability is threatened by the presence
          of invisible eavesdroppers (Eves). While the majority of research has relied
          on the unrealistic assumption of knowing Eve's position and channel state, this
          study tackles the challenge of secure multi-hop relaying without any Eve
          channel information. We (i) reformulate the notoriously intractable max-min
          secrecy-throughput problem into a tractable design, yielding an
          $\mathcal{O}(1)$ globally optimal radio-resource allocation; (ii) derive a
          closed-form expression of strictly positive secure connection probability
          under unknown Eve conditions and validate it across Rayleigh, Rician, and
          shadowed Rician fading; and (iii) construct the world's first open SAGSIN
          dataset, integrating SpaceX satellites, Google Loon HAPS, commercial 4G/5G
          base stations, and maritime vessels to bridge theory with real-world NTNs.
          This work pioneers a new physical-layer paradigm that guarantees security under
          uncertainty. It represents a game-changer for secure throughput-aware design in
          6G non-terrestrial networks, laying the groundwork for the next era of resilient
          ubiquitous connectivity.

          The <a href="https://github.com/secure-sagsin/sagsin-dataset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SAGSIN dataset</a>
          ships with a <code>tutorial.ipynb</code> that walks through three representative scenes:
          (1) a synthetic Natural Earth environment,
          (2) the Madagascar–Mozambique Channel with OpenCelliD + AIS + September 2020 HAPS logs, and
          (3) the Western North America corridor that fuses Mexican and U.S. coastal assets.
          Configure <code>env.DataManager</code> with the lon/lat windows noted in the notebook to re-create
          each map in a few lines.
        </p>
        <p class="panel__body">
          Once a window is fixed, the same loader instantly stitches together satellite snapshots,
          HAPS trails, terrestrial cells, maritime nodes, and manually defined users, so you can focus
          on routing objectives rather than data wrangling. The pills below summarize the most common usage patterns.
